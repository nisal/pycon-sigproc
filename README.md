Signals Processing code snippets from PyCon 2013 tutorial

Slideshare by Mel Chua:

  Digital signal processing through speech, hearing, and Python 

  Slides from PyCon 2013 tutorial reformatted for self-study. Code at https://github.com/mchua/pycon-sigproc, 
  original description  follows: Why do pianos sound different from guitars? 
  How can we visualize how deafness affects a child's speech? 
  These are signal processing questions, 
  traditionally tackled only by upper-level engineering students with MATLAB and differential equations; 
  we're going to do it with algebra and basic Python skills. 
  Based on a signal processing class for audiology graduate students, taught by a deaf musician.
